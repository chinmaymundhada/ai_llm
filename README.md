## Overview
This project implements an AI agent that extracts answers from a PDF document using OpenAI's LLM and posts them on Slack.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Set up environment variables in `.env` file.

3. Run the application:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## Improving Accuracy
- Use document chunking for better context handling.
- Implement a feedback loop to refine answers based on user interaction.

## Scalability
- Modular code structure allows easy scalability.
- Use cloud functions or a microservices architecture for deployment.
